My mustang-speed gem allows the user to pick a year from 1964 - 2017 (production years), and present a list of Mustang trims from that year. The user can select a trim, and the 0-60, 1/4 mile times will be listed. This was a challenging, but fun, project. I currently drive a 2001 Mustang (Bullitt), so picking a subject I could relate to helped my enjoyment. For some reason, scraping the year from the [0-60 specs website](https://www.0-60specs.com/ford-mustang-0-60-times/) was difficult, and took some time to implement. I wasn't very familiar with committing messages and using Github before this project, and I know those skills can still use some work. [Github repo here](https://github.com/michanders/mustang-speed-cli-app). Learning lots. Lots to learn.
